      <description>New website created as a portfolio for my wife&amp;rsquo;s knitting and crochet creations. I found a very nice Hugo theme for this purpose. Amazon S3 static site hosting is essentially free, so the only cost was domain registration. Next step is to try and setup a contact form running on AWS lambda. Take a look at beewhimzy.com</description>

      <description>Hugo Custom Output Formats Hugo v0.20 introduced a powerful new feature for your sites &amp;ndash; Custom Output Formats. As the release notes proudly proclaim:
 Hugo isn’t just that “static HTML with an added RSS feed” anymore. Say hello to calendars, e-book formats, Google AMP, and JSON search indexes, to name a few.
 Do you want to produce a page in multiple formats? Do you want to present content as CSV, AMP, or a calendar?</description>

      <description>Content Organization in Hugo v0.20 Recently the Hugo team introduced version 0.20 which included brand new Custom Output Formats. However, before you dive in to play with these new tools, be aware that the release did cause problems for some users. In certain cases, some files ended up in unexpected locations when a site was published.
These problems were related to Content Organization. The most common method for organizing files is to maintain separation between content files and static files.</description>
